# rest-conventions

### Motivation: 
I need a documentation where I will be able to find answer for any question about designing api. Plus some checklist of good points for any api. Document is not absolute truth and more like my vision about how to design api, based on my experience, articles and books.

## Content:

* [crud api rules](https://github.com/IgorPerikov/rest-conventions/blob/master/crud.md)
* [tips](https://github.com/IgorPerikov/rest-conventions/blob/master/tips.md)
